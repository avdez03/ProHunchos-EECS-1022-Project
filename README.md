### **Project Idea :  What number am I thinking of? (Between 1 and x, and the user also inputs how many tries you have)**
Our group will create an application that allows the user to play a game called “What number am I thinking of.” The application will ask the user for a random number greater than one then the application will generate a random number from one to the number inputted by the user. Then the application will ask the user for how many guesses they are allowed to use. Then now it is the user’s job to guess what the number is. If they guess correctly they will win and if they guess incorrectly and run out of guesses they lose. Once the user guesses correctly the application will output a message telling the user they guessed correctly and then the application will ask the user their name. Then add their name to a list of which can be displayed through the click of a button with the text “Leaderboards” in it. When the leaderboards button is clicked it will display an alert informing the player of the names of users who have guessed correctly. The user can learn how to play by clicking a button with the text “How to play” in it which will show an alert informing the user how to play. The application will start once the player clicks a button with the text “Start” in it. Then a pop up window will appear asking for the first value which will be used as an upper limit for the random number generator and then the next value will be their total number of guesses. The application will receive the user’s guess through a plaintext box. There will then be a final button which will be used to verify the user’s guess once it is inputted into the plaintext box. So they would input their choice into the textbox then click the button to verify their choice. Finally there will be a checkbox with the text “Music player” beside it that will allow the user to play background music during the game. In addition there will be text beside the verify guess button that will display the amount of guesses the user has left. Will also alter colors of text, buttons and include an appealing background to make the application look nice to the user.
 

**Functional Requirements**
1. Button with text “how to play” below the title will show user how to play through an alert box when clicked
2. Button with text “start” below “the how to play” button will start the game asking the user for upper limit and amount of guesses.
3. Input box below the “start” button will allow the user to input their guess.
4. Button with text “Verify guess”will allow user to check if their guess is correct
5. Once the “start” button is pressed a random number from 1 to the number inputted for upper limit will be outputted.
6. There will be text beside the “Verify guess” button that will display the amount of remaining guesses to the user.
7. Checkbox with text Music player beside it, and below the “Verify guess” button when true will play background music. When false will turn music off. 
8. When the user guesses correctly they will be asked for their name then their name will be added to a list of winners.
9. This list of winners could be accessed through clicking the button with text “leaderboard” in it, which would be beside the Music player checkbox. The list of winners would be shown through an alert.
10. In this “leaderboard”, the winners will be ranked according to the number of wins each winner has(the one with the most wins will be 1st, the one with second most wins will be 2nd and so on) 
11. If the user runs out of guesses an alert telling them they have run out of guesses will pop up.
12. When the user guesses correctly text will be altered below the “Verify guess” button informing the user they have guessed correctly.
13. When the user guesses incorrectly text will be altered below the “Verify guess” button informing the user they have guessed incorrectly.
